# Task description:
Implement a singly linked ordered circular list without repeats and a package of methods for it.
 
 
 &nbsp;



## Methods

- Add_Node (int data)  --  Adds an element by value to the list, inserting it in ascending order of the element's value. The existing element will not be added.
- Delete_Node (int data)  --  Removes the given element by value. Removing from an empty list or deleting a non-existent element will do nothing.
- Clear_List ()  -- Clears memory, completely removes the list.
- Find_Node (int data) --  Tries to find the given element by value. Returns **true** if the element is found, **false** otherwise.
- Print_List () -- Prints the addresses of all elements of the list, their value and a link to the next element to the console.
- Merge (Node* List1, Node* List2) --  Merges two objects of the list class, placing the result in the 3rd list. List 1 and List 2 will remain unchanged.
